# Support
![Test](https://github.com/zinc-collective/support/workflows/Ruby/badge.svg)

Support is a hybrid hosted app/service as well as library solution for independent developers who want to provide a public inbox for receiving support requests without paying piles of money.

## Design

We have a [shared project folder] with design documentation and wireframes. Of particular interest are our [personas], [competitor analysis] and [positioning statement].
